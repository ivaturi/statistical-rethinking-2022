## Intro

* The two contexts of statistical modeling:
  * the model itself (the _small world_), where all possibilities are known and there are no (pure) surprises.
  * the context where the model is deployed (the _large world_), which contains observations not known/imagined in the small world.

* A central challenge of statistical modeling is distinquishing and navigating the two contexts (made specially difficult considering all models are essentially incomplete representations of the large world).
