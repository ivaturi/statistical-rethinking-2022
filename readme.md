Notes for Richard McElreath's course, Statistical rethinking 2022.

**Course page**: https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022
**Python implementation**: https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking_2
**Book**: https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/

The original accompanying code for the course is in R, but since I'm more comfortable with Python (and a Python implementation) is already available, I'm doing this in Python. *Hopefully*, when I'm comfortable with the subject matter I'll come around to doing this a second time in R.


**Course overview (from the website)**
*Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan* builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.
